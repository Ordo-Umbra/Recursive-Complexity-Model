Recursive Complexity Model (RCM): A Unified Framework for Emergence, Causality, and Quantum-Classical Transitions
Overview
RCM (Recursive Complexity Model) is a novel, empirically validated theoretical framework that unifies the emergence of complexity, causality, symbolic agency, and quantum-classical transition. It is anchored in both mathematical theorems and reproducible simulation code, with wide-ranging implications for physics, computation, and multi-agent systems.
Core Principle
The dynamics of any field or substrate maximize a generalized complexity functional
$$ \mathcal{L} = [C] - \lambda [I] + \kappa $$
where $[C]$ measures field complexity, $[I]$ is mutual information, and $[\kappa]$ scales processing capacity.
Key Features
Emergent Causality: Proven by the Causality Protection Theorem (CPT) and validated by maximal speed of information propagation $c = \sqrt{\alpha}$.
Symbolic and Informational Structure: Via persistent high-MI regions (landmarks, agents, cognitive analogs).
Quantum Feedback & Self-Classicalization: Via agent-environment interaction; proven "collapse" from coherence to pointer state attractors when actions are penalized adaptively.
Universal Applicability: Recursion, causality, and normativity extend from physics to biology, cognition, and society.
Falsifiability: All claims are reproduced in Python/Colab notebooks and can be tested/extended by others.
Analytic Results
Maximal Propagation Speed: Validated by parameter sweeps in simulation (see /notebooks).
Causality Protection Theorem (CPT): No closed timelike curves persist in RCM; causal, complexity-increasing trajectories are dynamically selected. All nontrivial regressions collapse or are suppressed.
Persistence Invariant: Stability and normativity emerge:
Systems ought to maximize coherent complexity ($\frac{dS}{dt} > 0$).
Actions violating causality/integrity collapse early.
Cooperative, mutual-information-rich networks persist longer.
