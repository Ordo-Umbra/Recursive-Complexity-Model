# Mini RCM Reasoning Agent

The Mini Recursive Complexity Model (RCM) Reasoning Agent is a lightweight prototype that operationalizes the Sâ€‘functional in a discreteâ€‘time reasoning loop. It is designed as both a demonstration and a minimal browser-hosted agent for interactive exploration.

ðŸ”‘ Core Principle
At each step, the agent maximizes the functional:

S(\phi{t+1} \mid \phit) = \Delta C(\phi{t+1}, \phit) + \kappa \cdot \Delta I(\phi{t+1}, \phit)

- Î”C â†’ change in structural complexity (entropy + graph edges)  
- Î”I â†’ change in mutual information across active relations  
- Îº â†’ adaptive tradeâ€‘off between exploration and coherence  

This ensures the agent avoids trivial equilibria (pure order) and chaotic divergence (pure noise).

ðŸ§  State Representation
- Belief vector \mathbf{v} \in [0,1]^d: soft activations over d atoms  
- Adjacency graph A: sparse binary edges encoding semantic relations  
- Initialization: uniform priors, selfâ€‘loops only  

This hybrid structure allows both propositional and relational reasoning.

ðŸ”„ Reasoning Loop
1. Propose candidate actions (perturb activations, toggle edges, merge nodes, inject noise).  
2. Evaluate Î”C and Î”I for each candidate.  
3. Select action maximizing S.  
4. Classicalization step: snap nearâ€‘binary beliefs to 0/1, pruning unstable edges.  
5. Iterate until Î”S stabilizes or a step limit is reached.  

The loop converges to local optima, with optional annealing for global search.

ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Inference layer: topâ€‘scoring beliefs by Îºâ€‘weighted coherence  
- Trace log: \{t, St, Î”Ct, Î”I_t\} for replay and analysis  
- Visualization: evolving belief graph (nodes + edges) and Î”C/Î”I trajectories  

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Demonstration: Shows how RCM principles can be embodied in a minimal agent running in a browser.  
- Research testbed: Provides a falsifiable, extensible substrate for experimenting with motif overlays, symbolic persistence, and cognitive dynamics.  
- Educational bridge: Makes the abstract mathematics of RCM tangible for contributors and students.

ðŸ‘‰ Suggested next step: host this agent as a GitHub Pages demo so visitors can interactively watch the reasoning loop evolve. This would make the README not just a theoretical entry point, but a live demo.
