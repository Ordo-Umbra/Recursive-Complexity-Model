Recursive Complexity Model (RCM)

A unified framework deriving physics, cognition, and ethics from recursive complexity maximization.OverviewThe Recursive Complexity Model (RCM) is a foundational theory that unifies fundamental physics, biological evolution, cognitive processes, and ethical behavior through a single principle: the recursive maximization of complexity and coherence. RCM derives the Standard Model of particle physics, explains spacetime and gravity as emergent phenomena, and provides a mathematical basis for intelligence and moral reasoning.
