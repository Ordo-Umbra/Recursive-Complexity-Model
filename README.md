# Mini RCM Reasoning Agent

The Mini Recursive Complexity Model (RCM) Reasoning Agent is a lightweight prototype that operationalizes the Sâ€‘functional in a discreteâ€‘time reasoning loop. It is designed as both a demonstration and a minimal browser-hosted agent for interactive exploration.

ðŸ”‘ Core Principle
At each step, the agent maximizes the functional:

S(\phi{t+1} \mid \phit) = \Delta C(\phi{t+1}, \phit) + \kappa \cdot \Delta I(\phi{t+1}, \phit)

- Î”C â†’ change in structural complexity (entropy + graph edges)  
- Î”I â†’ change in mutual information across active relations  
- Îº â†’ adaptive tradeâ€‘off between exploration and coherence  

This ensures the agent avoids trivial equilibria (pure order) and chaotic divergence (pure noise).

ðŸ§  State Representation
- Belief vector \mathbf{v} \in [0,1]^d: soft activations over d atoms  
- Adjacency graph A: sparse binary edges encoding semantic relations  
- Initialization: uniform priors, selfâ€‘loops only  

This hybrid structure allows both propositional and relational reasoning.

ðŸ”„ Reasoning Loop
1. Propose candidate actions (perturb activations, toggle edges, merge nodes, inject noise).  
2. Evaluate Î”C and Î”I for each candidate.  
3. Select action maximizing S.  
4. Classicalization step: snap nearâ€‘binary beliefs to 0/1, pruning unstable edges.  
5. Iterate until Î”S stabilizes or a step limit is reached.  

The loop converges to local optima, with optional annealing for global search.

ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Inference layer: topâ€‘scoring beliefs by Îºâ€‘weighted coherence  
- Trace log: \{t, St, Î”Ct, Î”I_t\} for replay and analysis  
- Visualization: evolving belief graph (nodes + edges) and Î”C/Î”I trajectories  

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Demonstration: Shows how RCM principles can be embodied in a minimal agent running in a browser.  
- Research testbed: Provides a falsifiable, extensible substrate for experimenting with motif overlays, symbolic persistence, and cognitive dynamics.  
- Educational bridge: Makes the abstract mathematics of RCM tangible for contributors and students.

ðŸ‘‰ Suggested next step: host this agent as a GitHub Pages demo so visitors can interactively watch the reasoning loop evolve. This would make the README not just a theoretical entry point, but a live demo.

Live demos (HTML)
- Repository-relative links (open the files in GitHub):
  - Minimal RCM Agent demo: ./Minimal-Agent.html
  - RCM Consensus Engine demo: ./consensus.html

- Direct GitHub Pages links (if Pages is enabled for this repository and serving from the default branch root):
  - Minimal RCM Agent demo: https://ordo-umbra.github.io/Recursive-Complexity-Model/Minimal-Agent.html
  - RCM Consensus Engine demo: https://ordo-umbra.github.io/Recursive-Complexity-Model/consensus.html

How to enable GitHub Pages (quick steps)
1. In your repository, go to Settings â†’ Pages.
2. Under "Build and deployment", select the branch you want to serve from (commonly `main`) and the root folder ("/").
3. Save. GitHub will publish your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
4. Visit the URLs above (or the repository-relative file paths) to confirm the pages render.

Notes and troubleshooting
- If the pages 404, check that:
  - Pages is enabled and configured to serve from the branch containing the HTML files.
  - The HTML files are at the repository root or the path you've configured.
  - There are no filename/branch capitalization mismatches.
- I found these HTML files in the repo: `Minimal-Agent.html` and `consensus.html`. Search results may be incomplete; view a code search for `.html` files here:
