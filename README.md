Recursive Complexity Model (RCM): A Unified Framework for Emergence, Causality, and Quantum-Classical TransitionsOverviewRCM (Recursive Complexity Model) is a novel, empirically validated theoretical framework that unifies the emergence of complexity, causality, symbolic agency, and quantum-classical transition. It is anchored in both mathematical theorems and reproducible simulation code, with wide-ranging implications for physics, computation, and multi-agent systems.Core Principle:
The dynamics of any field or substrate maximize a generalized complexity functionalwhere [C] measures field complexity, [I] is mutual information, and [\kappa] scales processing capacity.Key FeaturesEmergent Causality proven by the Causality Protection Theorem (CPT) and validated by maximal speed of information propagation [c = \sqrt{\alpha}].Symbolic and Informational Structure via persistent high-MI regions (landmarks, agents, cognitive analogs).Quantum Feedback & Self-Classicalization via agent-environment interaction; proven "collapse" from coherence to pointer state attractors when actions are penalized adaptively.Universal Applicability: Recursion, causality, and normativity extend from physics to biology, cognition, and society.Falsifiability: All claims are reproduced in Python/Colab notebooks and can be tested/extended by others.Analytic ResultsMaximal Propagation Speed:Validated by parameter sweeps in simulation (see /notebooks).Causality Protection Theorem (CPT):
No closed timelike curves persist in RCM; causal, complexity-increasing trajectories are dynamically selected. All nontrivial regressions collapse or are suppressed.Persistence Invariant:
Stability and normativity emerge:Systems ought to maximize coherent complexity ([dS/dt > 0])Actions violating causality/integrity collapse earlyCooperative, mutual-information-rich networks persist longerQuickstartClone the repo and open /notebooks/RCM_Physics_Quantum_Demo.ipynb in Google Colab.Run all cells to reproduce: phase diagrams, complexity/dynamics plots, quantum feedback transitions, action bias/persistence, and symbolic emergence metrics.The main notebook includes:Analytic derivations & code for maximum velocityAgent/field recursive evolutionQuantum feedback self-classicalization sweepSymbol tracker and information landscape visualizationExample: Quantum Feedback ResultsFigure: Decoherence feedback forces rapid transition to classical pointer state, as measured by complexity S(t), action bias, and persistence.Documentation/docs/RCM_Overview.md: Full theoretical background, analytic proofs, and cross-domain generalization (including "ought-from-is" ethics derivation)/notebooks: Working Colab/Jupyter simulations for physics, quantum, and symbolic analysis/results: Key output plots and tables for easy comparison to theoryCommunity & ContributingOpen to collaboration, feedback, issues, and ideasPlease use Issues or Discussions for suggestions, bug reports, or theory extensions.CitationIf you use RCM in research or applications, please cite as:[Your Name].
